# f1_analysis

- How consistently do people overperform in qulifying vs race. who are the biggest overperformers (feature engineer positions gained metric)? What races have the biggest overperformances?
- biggest underperformers in f1 based on qualifying to race
- Who OWNED a circuit. best drivers at certain circuits e.g senna at monaco or hamilton at silverstone BUT WHO ELSE has gone unoticed. maybe use average finishing position
- how does constructer performance affect driver results. are there anomolies e.g raikonnen in 2012
- How much do DNFs distort perceptions of driver performance (may be hard to separate crashes from technical)?
- Era dominance. How dominant was this driver relative to the races available in their era? wins_per_race = wins / races_started. obviously MS raced alot less than LH and even further back LF raced eeeeeeven less.
- Fastest lap times for longest serving races like silverstone etc. (find this out by counting number of times a GP appears based on year in the dataframe)

Challenges 
- normalise points depending on era. make it the modern equivalent
